# hemibrain_olf_data
Data on FIB hemibrain olfactory neurons that will be useful for analysis in upcoming FIB hemibrain papers

It includes primary data such as classification of hemibrain uniglomerular Projection Neurons (uPNs) by:

* bodyid, here named as skid
* glomerulus for uni- or biglomerular PNs
* lineage
* type name

and comparison of certain features with FAFB.
